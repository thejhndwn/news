# news

So right now this holds some code for making a 3D world, which I would want to make interactive to show ongoing events in the world. 

However, I'm going to diverge from that and start a little simpler.

First I'm going to make a news collection and aggregation system. Then this will feed into a NewsService which will provide context and things before feeding to a TTS model. Effectively creating a 24/7 radio bot. 

Then we will expand this by creating a 3D avatar news host, creating a 24/7 automated news anchor. 

Afterwards we will expand to create a 3D interactive world in which you can interact with the world and view the news.

The last addition to this project will be adding user feeds, which will allow for following certain news feeds based on location and or people.
